    "\n",
    "There exist a homogeneous set of vehicles $\\mathcal{K} = \\{0, 1, \\cdots m\\}$, each with capacity $\\mathcal{Q}$. The set $\\mathcal{N}_0 = \\mathcal{N} \\backslash \\{0\\}$ is a customer set and every customer $i \\in \\mathcal{N}_0$ has demand $q_i$ and a request to be served within a prespecified time interval $[a_i, b_i]$. The time taken by a vehicle to serve customer $i$ is denoted by $t_i$ and the distance from $i$ to $j$ is denoted by $d_{ij}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each vehicle emits a certain amount of GHG (Greenhouse Gas) when traveling over an arc $(i, j)$. This amount is dependent on a number of factors, such as load and speed, among others. Whereas some of these factors are fixed (e.g. gravity and slope), the load and speed variables can be controlled. The load of a vehicle is made up of empty load (*curb weight*) and carried load (*gross vehicle weight rating*).\n",
    "\n",
    "The speed at which a vehicle travels on arc $(i, j)$ is constrained by a lower bound and an upper bound, denoted $l_{ij}$ and $u_{ij}$, respectively, usually imposed by traffic regulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on this introduction, we will consider three problems, all of which involve finding a set of tours for the set $\\mathcal{K}$ of vehicles that start and end at the depot, such that the total load carried by any vehicles does not exceed its capacity Q. These problems differ with respect to their objective functions, some of which are related to the environment.\n",

    "These objectives are:\n",
    "\n",

    "- an energy-minimising objective function assuming speed as a decision.\n",
